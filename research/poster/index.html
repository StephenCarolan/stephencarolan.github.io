        <h1>The Dichotomy of Atmospheric Escape in AU Mic b</h1>
        <h3><u>S. Carolan</u>, A. A. Vidotto, P. Plavchan, C. Villarreal D'Angelo, G. Hazra</h3>
        <p>     
          The large high-energy flux young close-in planets receive from their host stars can lead to strong atmospheric evaporation. For these planets, 
          their atmospheres take the form of dense photoevaporative hydrogen outflows, which expand into the winds of their host stars. The stellar wind exerts 
          pressure in the expanding planetary atmosphere and, if sufficiently strong, it can affect planetary atmospheric escape rates and spectroscopic transit 
          signatures. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200613606C/abstract"><u>Here</u></a>, we study the dichotomy of the escaping atmosphere of the newly discovered close-in exoplanet AU Mic b. On one hand, the high EUV stellar 
          flux is expected to cause a strong atmospheric escape in AU Mic b. On the other hand, the wind of this young star is believed to be very strong, which could 
          reduce or even inhibit the planet's atmospheric escape. AU Mic is thought to have a wind mass-loss rate that is up to 1000 times larger than the solar wind 
          mass-loss rate. Through 3D hydrodynamics simulations, we show that, as the stellar wind becomes stronger, the evaporation rate of AU Mic b is reduced and its 
          atmosphere is forced to occupy a smaller volume. This affects Ly-α transit signatures, which is reduced from 20% in the case of no wind interaction to barely 
          any absorption in the extreme stellar wind scenario. Future Ly-α transits could therefore place constraints not only on the evaporation rate of AU Mic b, but 
          also on the mass-loss rate of its host star.

                We adapt SWMF's GM module to perform 3D models of AU Mic b's atmospheric escape.
                The computational grid is centred on the planet, with each hydrodynamic simulation performed in the planet's rest frame.
                We account for the orbital effects associated with close-in exoplanets, and inject the stellar wind as an outer boundary.
                We vary the strength of the stellar wind in each simulation from no wind to 1000 M&#775<sub>⊙</sub>, obtaining a 3d grid of densities,
                velocities and thermal pressure.

            We perform five simulations of AU Mic b, each with a different stellar wind strength: no wind, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 M&#775<sub>⊙</sub>.
            The orbital slice from each of these can be seen in the figure above. The bottom right panel shows the region containing absorbing material. It is clear
            that as the stellar wind strength is increased the aobsorbing material is confined closer to the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, this confinement affects the sonic surface of the outflowing atmosphere, such that material on the day-side no longer accelerates to super-sonic 
            speeds. It is instead funneled towards the comet-like tail. This causes a reducing escape rate as the stellar wind strength is increased.

          <h1>Observational Signatures</h1>
          <p>
            Given that the absorbing planetary material now occupies a smaller volume around the planet, and the atmospheric escape rate has been reduced, 
            changes in the Ly-α absorption are to be expected. We perform synthetic Ly-α transit calculations on each of our 3d grids obtaining the Ly-α
            line profiles at mid transit. We ignore the line centre [-36, 36 km/s] given it will be contaminated by interstellar aborption and geocoronal emission,
            and plot the blue and red wings for each model below.

          <p>
            We integrate the red and blue wings of each Ly-α line profile, obtaining the percentage absorption of each of each wing. The resultant values can 
            be seen in the figure to the left. This allows us to quantify the line asymmetry of the Ly-α line for each stellar wind strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            For stellar winds &#8804 10 M&#775<sub>⊙</sub>, the blue wing shows significantly more absorption than the red wing. The stellar wind funnels day-side 
            material towards the comet-like tail, leading to asymmetry in the line profile. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For stellar winds &#8805 100 M&#775<sub>⊙</sub>, we find no significant absorption in the blue or red wing. The stellar wind is now strong enough to
            confine the outflowing planetary material much closer to the planet, such that the volume occupied by the absorbing hydrogen is greatly reduced.
            This leads to very little Ly-α absorption.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of this work place importance on future Ly-α observations. In the case of AU Mic b, we have shown that future Ly-α observations can 
            provide insight into the stellar wind. Should future observations yield a non-detection of AU Mic b's escaping atmosphere, then we can place a 
            lower limit on the stellar mass loss rate at 100 M&#775<sub>⊙</sub>. Should future observations find significant blue shifted absorption, we can 
            conclude that AU Mic has a mass loss rate below this value. Furthermore, we have shown that the strength of the stellar wind can significantly 
            contributes to the resultant Ly-α line profile, and so must be considered when interpreting the Ly-α observations close-in exoplanets.

            <ul>
								
            <li>
                We find that as the stellar wind strength is increased the mass loss rate of the planet decreases.
                This is due to the interaction between the stellar and planetary material, which does not allow the day-side 
                outflow to reach super-sonic speeds. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We find that this decreased escape rate and confinement of planetary material affects the Ly-α absorption, as the absorbing
                material now occupies a lower volume.
            </li>
            <li>
                This places further importance on follow up observations of AU Mic b in Ly-α, as they may allow for a constraint to be placed
                on the stellar wind mass-loss rate. Should a non-detection of the escaping atmosphere
                be found, this suggests that the stellar wind mass-loss rate is greater than 100 times solar. Should a blueshift dominant absorption
                be found, the stellar wind mass loss rate is less than this value.
